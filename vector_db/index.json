economic measurement of dream content\naspects (section 5). In the last sections of this paper, mea-\nsurement quality (reliability and validity) and several meth-\nodological issues which play a role in data analysis, e. g. the\nproblem of dream length, will be addressed.\nBasic assumptions\t2.\nBefore the basic assumptions and the goals of dream con-\ntent analysis are discussed, a fictitious example should il-\nlustrate the applicability of content analysis. A research\npsychologist is asked by a colleague who works as a thera-\npist whether his impression that depressed patients often\ndream about rejection can be generalized. In order to test\nthis hypothesis, the researcher develops, in corroboration\nwith the clinician, a dream content scale which measures\nsituations that include some form of rejection. The next step\nis the data collection of dream reports of depressed patients\nand dream reports of gender- and age-matched healthy\ncontrols.

The statistical analysis\ncan reveal, after coding the variable “depression vs. healthy\ncontrols” to each dream report, whether there is a signifi-\ncant difference between these two samples, i. e., whether\ndepressed patients dream more often about rejection than\nhealthy persons.\nThe above mentioned example stresses the crucial aim of\ncontent analysis; that particular aspects of the verbal mate-\nrial (in the example: rejection) have to be quantified in order\nto carry out statistical analyses (cf. Hall & Van de Castle,\n1966). Statistical tests are of importance for differentiat-\ning between find","source":"Schredl, M. (2010). Dream content analysis: Basic principles.

(in the example: rejection) have to be quantified in order\nto carry out statistical analyses (cf. Hall & Van de Castle,\n1966). Statistical tests are of importance for differentiat-\ning between findings which are due to chance and findings\nwhich might reflect “real” differences in the population. It\nis, however, not possible to differentiate exactly but only\nto a distinct amount of error probability. The application of\ndream content analysis is manifold: for group comparisons\n(see example above), for the analysis of dream series and\ncorrelational studies between dream content and psycho-\nmetric measured waking-life variables, e. g. personality di-\nmensions. The advantages of content analysis in contrast\nto an intuitive comparison are also evident from the above\noutlined example.

And, third,\nthe researcher specifies explicitly which dream reports were\nanalyzed, the characteristics of the sample and the method\nof data analysis (most recent dream, diary dreams, and lab-\noratory dreams).\nOn the other hand, content analysis has some shortcom-\nings. By application of specific scales, a loss of information\ntakes place since only a few aspects of the dream report\ncan be measured. The uniqueness of dreams of a particular\nperson can not be captured. An additional problem which\nwill be discussed in section 6 is the validity of the dream\ncontent scales.

a specific hypothesis, e.g., increased\nrejection rate in dreams of patients with depression, is the\nreduction of the expenditure and the increase of statistical\npower because one needs not to correct for multiple testing.\nIf the researcher, on the other hand, applies a dream manual\nwith over 300 different subscales (e.g., Hall & Van de Castle,\n1966), then several significant findings at a p = .05 would be\nexpected by chance; an application of an alpha-adjusting\nprocedure inevitably reduces statistical power for detecting\ndifferences. The next step is to select an existing scale (see\nsection 4) or developing a new scale. This depends on the\nstudy’s hypotheses. For new scales, it is necessary to com-\npute interrater reliability indices in order to document the\nquality of the scale.\nIt should be very carefully documented how dream reports\nwere elicited (cf. Winget & Kramer, 1979) since the type of\ndream report used for the analysis might have a strong ef-\nfect on the findings. Th","source":"Schredl, M. (2010). Dream content analysis: Basic principles.

If well-established scales were applied, this is\nnot necessary because one can refer to the indices given\nby the author or subsequent studies using this particular\nscale.\nAnalyzing the data after adding the coding of the dream’s\norigin (depressed patient vs. healthy person) has to be done\nvery carefully to avoid problems like dependent observa-\ntions (statistical dependency) or multiple tes","source":"Schredl, M.

on the number of dream reports and\nnumber of scales.\nScales for dream content analysis\t4.\nIn their book “Dimensions of dreams”, Winget and Kramer\n(1979) have put together 132 scales and rating systems for\ndream content analysis that have been published in Eng-\nlish. In view of the abundance, the question arises whether\nit is still necessary to develop new scales or will it be suf-\nficient to apply already existing scales, if necessary, in their\nappropriate translation. Clark, Trinder, Kramer, Roth, & Day\n(1972), for example, have shown that the masochism scale\ndeveloped by Beck and Hurvich (1959) can be derived by\nsumming up a few categories of the Hall and Van de Castle\n(1966) rating system. On the other hand, Hauri (1975), who\ncarried out a factor analysis of 23 scales of different authors\nfor 100 dreams pointed out that scales, which measures\nsimilar characteristics, e. g. dreamlike quality, only correlate\nto about r = 0.5 with each other.

100 dreams pointed out that scales, which measures\nsimilar characteristics, e. g. dreamlike quality, only correlate\nto about r = 0.5 with each other. This means that 75 % of the\nvariance is unexplained and one might assume that each\nscale measures specific aspects.\nA simple recipe how to construct a valid dream content\nscale seems not to exist. Hall and Van de Castle (1966) have\nsuggested, first, the need to read many dream reports in\norder to obtain an insight into the variety of dream experi-\nences. However, one has to be careful not to include the\nmaterial which should by analyzed in respect to the hypoth-\nesis since such a scale will measure the aspects which one\nread into it.

content analysis: Basic principles\ndependently a number of dream reports in order to com-\npute interrater reliability coefficients (see section 6). In cases\nwhere the coefficients are low, the subjective experiences\nof the judges and a discussion of the disagreements often\nallows an improvement of the scale. However, guidelines or\ncut-off values classifying “good” and “poor” reliability do\nnot exist in dream research.\nFor measuring dream characteristics, three kinds of scales\nare commonly differentiated (see Table 3). Content analytic\nscales in the narrow sense are defined as nominal scale, e.\ng., occurrence of persons (mother, child, friend etc) or ag-\ngression (physical, verbal etc…) within the rating system of\nHall and Van de Castle (1966).

The fact that\nthis scale is also not free from theory becomes clear if one\nlooks at the equivalent coding of persons who appear in the\ndream and persons who were only mentioned in the dream.\nTheoretical scales are scales which are derived from a par-\nticular theory and which are tested empirically by applying\nthis scale to a sample of dream reports. Hall and Van de\nCastle (1966) have derived from the psychoanalytic theory\n(adding a variety of prepositions) the scales ‘penis envy’,\n‘castration anxiety’ and ‘castration wish’. If one looks at\nthe coding rules and the given examples of the castration\nanxiety scale, e. g., “My finger was cut off.”, “I wasn’t able\nto get an erection.”, “I couldn’t get my key in the lock.”, it","source":"Schredl, M.

Global rating scale offers the opportunity to\nmeasure intensity, e.g. the intensity of negative emotions by\nusing a four-point scale (none, mild, moderate, strong) ap-\nplied by an external judge.

Gaillard and Phelippeau (1977) have sug-\ngested that the most intense occurrence of a category, e. g.\nnegative emotion, should be assessed in a sense of a global\nrating scale and that this scale has an ordinal measurement\nlevel. In that way, dreams can be classified into more or less\naggressive or emotional intense dreams. Very simple global\nrating scale assesses the presence or absence of a par-\nticular theme (e. g. health related topics, respiratory-related\ntopics).

In a\nstudy carried out by Strauch and Meier (1996), the partici-\npants were asked whether dream elements occurred within\nthe one’s waking thoughts.\nTo summarize, all three kinds of scales have their pros and\ncons which, however, have rarely been investigated system-\natically.

elements occurred within\nthe one’s waking thoughts.\nTo summarize, all three kinds of scales have their pros and\ncons which, however, have rarely been investigated system-\natically. For research practice, the question of which type of\nscale is the most appropriate for the study’s rationale can be\napplied with justifiable expenditure.\nDream manuals\t5.\nThe term dream manual is used for collections or systems\nof content analytic scales which are aimed at the compre-\nhensive measurement of the dream experiences or at least\nthe major dream characteristics.

The idea to extract\nthe most important scales dates back to Hauri, Sawyer and\nRechtschaffen (1967) who carried out a factor analysis of\n20 ordinal scales and obtained 6 factors: “vivid fantasy” (in-\ncluding realism), “active control”, “pleasantness”, “verbal\naggression”, “physical aggression” and “heterosexuality”.\nBased on these findings and own experiences, the manual\nof Schredl (1991) and the subsequent versions (Schredl,\n1998b; Schredl, Schäfer, Hofmann, & Jacob, 1999; Schredl,\nSchäfer, Weber, & Heuser, 1998; Schredl, Schröder, & Löw,\n1996) enclosed the basic scales which are depicted","source":"Schredl, M.

in Table\n6.\nThe advantage of this rating system lies within the clear-\nness and the simple applicability of the basic scales and\nthe requirement to think about every new scale which must\nbe developed for a study measuring aspects which are not\nassessed by the basic scales. For example, Schredl (1991)\ndeveloped a three-point scale for measuring the occur-\nrence of problems within in a dream (none, minor and major\nproblems) in order to test the hypothesis whether patients\nwith insomnia tend to have more problematic dreams than\nhealthy controls.

For example, the compari-\nson of physical aggression in women’s dreams and in men’s\ndreams should be independent from the utilization of a con-\ntent analytic scale or a global rating scale.\nQuality criteria: Reliability and validity\t6.\nIn this section, the quality criteria of reliability and validity\nwill be discussed. Whereas the procedure to obtain reli-\nability coefficients in dream content analysis is very simple\nand straightforward, the assessment of the scales’ validity\nis much more complex. Similarly, the analysis of the data\nwhich follows the dream collection and the rating process\npresents some difficulties.\nThe reliability coefficient is determined as measure of cor-\nrespondence between different judges, i.e., two or more\njudges rate the same dreams and – according to the scales’\nmeasurement levels – coefficients of exact agreement,\nSpearman rank correlations or Pearson correlations can be\ncomputed.

two or more\njudges rate the same dreams and – according to the scales’\nmeasurement levels – coefficients of exact agreement,\nSpearman rank correlations or Pearson correlations can be\ncomputed. By “exact agreement” the proportion of codings\nexactly the same between the two judges to all codings is\nmeant. These coefficients indicate how consistent the rat-\nings of two different judges, who rate the same dreams, are\nfor a distinct scale. Low values mean that the subjectivity\nof the judges plays a major role in the rating process; this\ncan be found especially for scales with few and imprecise\ncoding rules. High values indicate a sufficient intersubjec-\ntive comparability. Hall and Van de Castle reported the fol-\nlowing reliability coefficients for their rating system, e. g.,\noccurrence of a person (93% exact agreement), and all fea-\ntures of a person (76%).

These coefficients are\nderived by comparison of the ratings done by the authors\nthemselves and, thus, indicate that even a comprehensive,\nexplicit formulation of coding rules and extensive practice\nyield a vagueness in some ratings.\nIn subsequent studies (e. g. Kramer & Roth, 1979) which\napplied parts of the Hall and Van de Castle system, the exact\nagreement for the rating of single aspects of dream charac-\nters exceeded 90%. The classification of emotions corre-\nsponded in 93% to 98% (Schredl & Doll, 1998). A drawback\nof the coefficient of exact agreement is the fact that high\ncoefficients will be obtained if the measured characteristic\noccurs rarely. In that case, the application of Cohen’s kappa\nis recommended (Cohen, 1960); a coefficient which is sel-\ndom used in dream research.\nFor","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

be obtained if the measured characteristic\noccurs rarely. In that case, the application of Cohen’s kappa\nis recommended (Cohen, 1960); a coefficient which is sel-\ndom used in dream research.\nFor ordinal scales’ reliability often Spearman rank correla-\ntions are computed. The coefficients for 17 different scales\nwhich were studied by Hauri, Sawyer and Rechtschaffen\n(1967) varied between .59 and .69. These values have been\nimproved by Gaillard and Phelippeau (1977) according to\ntheir account by reducing the categories of the scales from\nseven to five. However, they only reported exact agree-\nments ranging between 88% and 98% if the difference of\none point was allowed, but a direct comparison to the Hauri\net al. (1967) study was not carried out.

from three studies applying the\ndream manual of Schredl are depicted.\nThe correlation coefficients commonly varied between .70\nand .90. An exception was the correlation of the realism/\nbizarreness scale in the study of Schredl, Schröder and Löw\n(1996). Interestingly, the subsequent discussion revealed\nthat one judge who had grown up in another culture (Egypt)\nrated the realism of dream events in a different way. The\ninterrater agreement of the general nominal scales, e. g.\naggression, verbal interaction, was satisfactory with values\nranging from 88% to 100% (Schredl, Sahin, et al., 1998).\nOne exception was a scale for rating the ability to cope with\na problem within the dream (exact agreement: 58%).\nExperience with different coding systems in our research\ngroup indicates that a rater training with subsequent discus-\nsion of the disagreements is needed to obtain high interrater\nreliability.

one would like to measure. Many\nrating systems (e. g. Hall & Van de Castle, 1966) rely on\nthe so-called, face validity, i.e., one “sees” that the scale is\nmeasuring for what it has been constructed. If the coding\nrules, for example, describe the coding of explicitly men-\ntioned emotions such as guilt, anxiety, fear, embarrassment\nas “apprehension”, it seems obvious that this is given if a\ndreamer reports that she/he has experienced anxiety during\nthe dream. This coding of explicitly mentioned emotions,\nhowever, has shortcomings if applied to the following fic-\ntive dream report: “I see a monster and run away as fast as\npossible.” It can be hypothesized that the dream ego expe-\nriences fear but did not mention it explicitly in her/his dream\nreport. The emotion score of zero did not reflect the emotion\nwhich really occurred. The major validity problem arises be-\ncause analyzed dream reports are more or less detailed in\nreflecting the actual dream experience. Astonishingly, very\nfew","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

cannot\nexceed its reliability.\nUsing the example of measuring dream emotions, some\nissues which are important for the assessment of validity\nwill be demonstrated in the following. First, the problem of\nearlier studies (e. g. Hauri, et al., 1967) which used a bipolar\nscale for measuring dream emotions (strongly negative to\nstrongly positive emotions) has to be addressed since, for\nexample, Gaillard and Phelippeau (1977) have shown that\n13 % of all dreams included positive and negative emotions.\nIn a sample of diary dreams, the proportion (34 %) was still\nhigher (Schredl & Doll, 1998). In contrast to two separate\nscales for measuring positive and negative emotions, this\nbipolar scale will result in an underestimation of the less\npronounced emotion. The second problem was the ques-\ntion whether the dream ego experiences the same emotions\nin specific situations in the dream which she/he also would\nexperience in waking-life (appropriateness of dream emo-\ntions).

Analyzing\n133 dream reports, Schredl and Doll (1998) have investi-\ngated the relationship between three types of scales, the\nemotion scale of Hall and Van de Castle, the rating scales\nfor external judges constructed by Schredl (1991) and two\nsimilar self-rating scales for measuring positive and nega-\ntive dream emotions. The classification of the dream reports\ninto four groups is depicted in Table 8.\nThe findings of this study clearly demonstrate an under-\nestimation of dream emotions if the Hall and Van de Castle\nemotion scales are applied,","source":"Schredl, M.

dream reports\ninto four groups is depicted in Table 8.\nThe findings of this study clearly demonstrate an under-\nestimation of dream emotions if the Hall and Van de Castle\nemotion scales are applied, i.e., if only explicitly mentioned\nemotions are measured, a good deal of information will be\nlost. Similarly, the rating scales designed for judges with\nthe similar format of the self-rating scales (four-point: none,\nmild, moderate, strong) did show a marked underestimation\nof dream emotions. This underestimation was even stronger\nfor positive emotions than for negative emotions (Schredl &\nDoll, 1998). Whereas the underestimation revealed a serious\ndrawback of ratings made by external judges, the correla-\ntions between external ratings and self-ratings were satis-\nfactory (negative emotions: r = .669; positive emotions: r =\n.557) since these values were almost as large as the reli-\nability coefficients of these scales.

A second study (Schredl\n& Erlacher, 2003) found a systematic underestimation of the\nnumber of bizarre elements per dream for estimates by ex-\nternal judges compared to the dreamer himself/herself. This\nclearly indicates that the dream report did not contain the\ncomplete information about all different characteristics of\nthe dream. Strauch and Meier (1996) have reported exam-\nples in which the experience of touching, e. g., touching a\npiece of cloth, was not explicitly mentioned by the dreamer\nin her dream report but was revealed after intense question-\ning. Similar results were obtained if colors in dreams were\nanalyzed: in 25 % of diary dream reports colors were report-\ned spontaneously (Schredl, 2008c), whereas 100% of diary\ndreams included colored objects when the dreamer was\nprobed to report all colored objects of the dream (Schredl,\nFuchedzhieva, Hämig,","source":"Schredl, M.

A basic preposition for\nmost statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Mann-Whitney-U test) is\nthe statistical independence of the observations. If repeated\nmeasurements were made (several dream reports per par-\nticipant), it is commonly assumed that these values are de-\npendent. In the study of Brink and Allen (1992), 139 dreams\nof 12 patients with eating disorders and 136 dreams of 11\nhealthy controls were compared. The difference regarding\ndegrees of freedom (N – 2) is considerable whether num-\nber of participants (df = 21) or number of dreams (df = 175)\nare the computation","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

11\nhealthy controls were compared. The difference regarding\ndegrees of freedom (N – 2) is considerable whether num-\nber of participants (df = 21) or number of dreams (df = 175)\nare the computational basis and, thus, the significant find-\nings based on the number of dreams which were report-\ned by Brink and Allen (1992) can be questioned. Although\nSchredl (Schredl, 1998a) demonstrated that the intercorre-\nlations between the scores of distinct scales such as real-\nism, positive and negative emotions are relatively small in\na sample of healthy persons (r < .10), this problem has to\nbe addressed by choosing an appropriate statistical pro-\ncedure. A possible solution to this problem which results in\nthe above mentioned reduction in the degrees of freedom is\nthe computation of means per participant. This will be a loss\nof statistical power. Another solution to the problem is the\napplication of analyses of variance for repeated measures\n(cf. Heather-Greener et al., 1996). This method can","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

This method can only be\napplied if participants contribute equal numbers of dream\nreports, i.e., often this will also result in an information loss.\nA more sophisticated approach is the use of mixed models\n(Schredl, 2006; Schredl & Reinhard, 2008) accounting for\nthe with-subject variance.\nAnother issue which was investigated by Kramer and Roth\n(1979) is the stability respectively the variability of dream\ncontent, i.e., how content varies from dream to dream. It\nmay be possible that one person has very vivid and bizarre\ndreams one night and the dreams of the following night are\nbland and realistic. This issue is especially of importance\nwhen dream content measures are related to trait aspects\nof waking-life such as personality dimensions.

Schredl (1998a) who has analyzed diary\ndreams of 98 participants (to a maximum of five dreams per\nparticipant) has found for dream length (r = .48) and number\nof dream persons (r = .30) significant correlations but not\nfor the scales “realism/bizarreness” (r = .08), “positive emo-\ntions” (r = .08), “negative emotions” (r = .18) and “verbal\ninteraction” (r = -.01","source":"Schredl, M.

This\nkind of reliability is consistent with the notion of measure-\nment stability and should not be conf","source":"Schredl, M. (2010). Dream content analysis: Basic principles.

This\nkind of reliability is consistent with the notion of measure-\nment stability and should not be confused with the interrater\nreliability (scales’ exactness of measurement). The effect of\nstability of dream content measures on the results of studies\ninvestigating the relationship between dream content and\npersonality dimensions has not been investigated system-\natically though one might hypothesize that it does play an\nimportant role.\nThe last problem regarding data analysis which will be\naddressed in this section is the problem of dream length.\nMany scales, especially sum scores of the content analytic\nscales, correlate strongly with dream length which is often\nmeasured by counting the words of the dream report.

On the other hand, Schredl (1999b) who\nanalyzed 537 dream reports, have demonstrated that the\nlinear correlation coefficients by far exceed the coefficients\nof quadratic and cubic correlations and, thus, the division\nby word count is a good approximation. Urbina (1981) has\nsuggested controlling dream length statistically using anal-\nyses of covariance or logistic regressions. Domhoff (1996)\nhas suggested using ratios (e.g., aggressive interaction per\ndream characters or ratio between aggressive and friendly\ninteractions) instead","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

of covariance or logistic regressions. Domhoff (1996)\nhas suggested using ratios (e.g., aggressive interaction per\ndream characters or ratio between aggressive and friendly\ninteractions) instead of absolute values (e.g., aggressions\nper dream). This approach also has disadvantages if scores\nfor single dreams have to be obtained, e.g. male/female\npercent cannot be computed for each dream and might vary\nconsiderably (0 to 100%) depending on the number of male\nand female dream characters. Using the number of male or\nfemale characters would avoid these problems.\nThe effect of dream length on the content analytic findings\nwill be especially pronounced if two groups are compared\nwhose dream length differ considerably, e. g. patients with\ninsomnia vs. healthy controls (Schredl, 1998b).\nConclusions\t8.\nAlthough the method of dream content analysis can be eas-\nily applied, several problems have to be considered. The\nmost often encountered topics are depicted in Table 9.\nIf no appropriate r","source":"Schredl, M. (2010). Dream content analysis: Basic principles.

The\nmost often encountered topics are depicted in Table 9.\nIf no appropriate rating scale is available in the literature,\nit is necessary to develop a new scale. This has to be done\nbefore the person constructing the scale has read any of the\ndreams to be analyzed because this will bias the definitions\nof the scale’s categories by adapting it to the material. Of\ncourse, the person can read dreams stemming from other\nstudies in order to get a feeling for how to measure specific\ntopics within a dream. This precaution is also necessary if\nthe scale has to be redefined because of low interrater re-\nliability. The editing of the scale must also be done by a\nperson who is not familiar with the specific dreams of the\nstudy. Otherwise, the interrater reliability would improve for\nthe given dream sample but not in general when applied to\na new sample of dreams.\nIn section 6,","source":"Schredl, M. (2010).

Foulkes's for an up to date account of the\nmajor area of interest in sleep by many psychologists, psychiatrists, and psycho-\nanalysts; namely, REMs and dreaming. With so much attention we may expect\nuseful findings, or alternately REM studies may suffer the fate, say, of the study\nof mental content through introspection. In the past, similar clusters of activity have\ngenerated a lot of heat and even some curiosity but have produced little if any solid\nscientific contribution.

The Murray book assumes that the reader possesses\nconsiderable technical sophistication but Foulkes beams his summary and interpreta-\ntion to \"the interested layman as well as the specialist.\" Both should be read with\nprofit by the psychologist.\nVirginia Military Institute DEAN FOSTER\nThe Content Analysis of Dreams.

earlier papers on the conceptual theory of dreams (C. S. Hall, A cognitive\ntheory of dreams, J. gen. Psychol., 48, 1953, 169-186) were extremely interesting\nDecause they challenged psychoanalytic orthodoxy about dreams. The present work,\nhowever, only supports one's suspicion that Hall has taken all that is dynamic out\nof dreams and put nothing in its place.\nIn the reviewer's opinion, the book lets one see content analysis at its best, in all\nits technical aspects-the instructions, norms, and classifications are concise; they\nare constructive and methodically presented. It is said to be the most comprehensive\nas yet devised. The book begins with a testimony to the value of content analysis, a\nmethod which has many advocates and which has been put to excellent use in almost\nevery humanistic field, in political theory, literature, history, biography, linguistics,\nfolklore, and communication-theory, not to mention every branch of personality and\npsychotherapy research.\nHall and Van de C","source":"Stephenson, W.

which might have had better support had the material\nof Chapter 15 been used for that purpose.\nChapter 3 defines the system, and from here to Chapter 13 all is a model of what\ncontent analysis as such, in its technical respects, can be. The classes are clearly\ndescribed, the scoring system adequately illustrated, and all is concise and to the\npoint. Norms, based on 1000 dreams of college students age 19 to 25 yr. are pro-\nvided in Chapter 14, and these tables are almost all that one could desire. Chapter\n15 reviews selected literature on scales of content analysis that have been used by\nothers; Hall and Van de Castle might have done well to start their book with the\nsubstance of this chapter, because it provides at least some good reasons for using\nthe manifest content of dreams, and categorical classes in the ancient manner of\nAristotle, as basic to a certain kind of study of dreams.

Nothing more\nsignificantly different is brought to light! This was also the case in the study by\nGriffith, Miyago, and Tago (R. M. Griffith, O. Miyago, and A. Tago, The universal-\nity of typical dreams: Japanese vs. Americans, Amer. Anthropol., 1958, 60, 1173-\n1179) in which the only significant differences concerned finding money, and\nkilling someone. Americans find more money than Japanese; American men report\nmore killings in their dreams than American women, and conversely Japanese women\nreport more killings thanrJapanese men. These are the only significant differences in\na list of 34 items of manifest content of dreams. Hall and Van de Castle refer also\nto a study by Co","source":"Stephenson, W. (1967).

rather than of anything particular to dynamic\ntheory of personality.\nThe outcome of all of this effort is no doubt of interest to someone. What it\nsuggests to this reviewer is massive identities in the manifest content of dreams.\nNo matter how one cuts the population-cake-into sex difference, social class,\nincome-groups, or the like--significant differences in manifest content (when cate-\ngorized in very broad or universal terms) are likely to be few and far between;\nand where differences appear they will rarely occasion much surprise.

not in the sense of its style or grammar but in the sense that all \"talk\"\ncan of course be categorized into settings, characters, props, activities, and attitudes\nas a matter of merely logical, not necessarily of psychological necessity.

that it is doubtful how far dreams\nreally tap deeper levels of personality dynamics. To say (page 26) that in content\nanalysis the system of classification \"should grow out of the material and reflect its\nintrinsic nature\" requires clarification as to what is to be regarded as intrinsic and\nwhat not. What is intrinsic in Hall and Van de Castle's case is apparently the\nAristotelian categorization of things, persons, and events. The outcome, surely,\nspeaks for itself. The truth is that content analysis in science can only be a test of\nsynthetic propositions, that is, of a body of theory of some kind.\nWhat, then, can be theoretical about dreams? It was to this question that I\nthought Hall was addressing himself in his earlier papers. For Hall is right, in my\nopinion, to challenge the Freudian standpoint that dreams are necessarily regressive,\nin the sense that, being fantasy, they substitute for painful emotions.

Written reports were analyzed\nwith the HVDC and results of the two instruments were compared using Pearson\ncorrelations. Results showed that correlations were high for dominant characters,\npleasantness of dream content, and body-related experiences.

of the two instruments were compared using Pearson\ncorrelations. Results showed that correlations were high for dominant characters,\npleasantness of dream content, and body-related experiences.

variety of methodologies has been used for the collection and analysis of dream reports, each\ncovering different aspects of dreaming (Klösch and Holzinger, 2014). Dream reports differ as a\nresult of setting, awakening method, collection technique, and analysis. Private settings produce\nmarkedly distinct reports from laboratory setting and influence dream recall (Foulkes, 1996;\nSchredl et al., 2003). Awakenings can be forced or spontaneous, and forced awakenings differ\nin the stimulus with which the dreamer is awakened (Dement and Wolpert, 1958; Klösch and\nHolzinger, 2014).

Klösch and Holzinger, 2014). Using the therapeutic setting to discover\nthe underlying meaning of a dream is an additional possibility to discover one’s dream world.\nFurthermore, dreams can be collected on a daily basis or in retrospect (Schredl, 1999; Watson,\n2003; Zadra and Geneviève, 2012). Several methodological shortcomings (e.g., how to interpret\npictures objectively) of one or the other method often led to a combination of different techniques.\nHowever, scientists mostly rely on questionnaires and written reports, with dream diaries being\nconsidered as the most important source of information regarding dream characteristics (Klösch\nand Holzinger, 2014).

with solid empirical support. However,\nthe system has its weaknesses: short (less than 50 words) and\nlong dreams (more than 300 words) cannot be analyzed. Learning\nhow to use the coding system, i.e., getting to know all available\ncategories, and the analysis of big samples is a quite time-\nconsuming task.\nTo allow for a less demanding, more structured analysis\nof dreams, a large number of dream questionnaires has been\ndeveloped. Unfortunately, most of them are still lacking\nstandardization and validation (e.g., Hauri et al., 1967;\nKallmeyer and Chang, 1997; Schredl, 1999, Schredl, 2004).

Nevertheless, in dream\nresearch there is a need of an easy-to-use instrument, which can\nbe completed by patients as well as healthy subjects over longer\ntime-periods. It should provide basic information regarding the\nformal criteria of the dream (frequency, length, time, etc.) as well\nas the content of the dream (themes, sources, emotional impact,\nthe dreamer’s involvement in the dream etc.).\nFor this purpose, we aimed to validate the Dreamland (DL-\nQ","source":"Holzinger, B., Mayer, L., Barros, I., Nierwetberg, F., & Klösch, G.

Since its first\nuse, the DL-Q has been developed further: some items were\nrephrased, some of the response categories were replaced with\nvisual analog scales (VAS), and the questionnaire was improved\nwith the help of test theorists. Fourteen items assess the dream\ncharacteristics and additionally, the back side of the questionnaire\ncan be used for a more detailed description of the dream.

of different subpopulations\n(Klösch et al., 1999a,b; Holzinger et al., 2001, 2015; Lorenzo\net al., 2002). We suggest that the DL-Q might be able to provide\nadditional information about the nature of certain psychological\ndisorders, and found, for instance, that the emotionality and\nthought content typical for eating disorders such as aggression\nin anorexics are also experienced in dreams (Holzinger et al.,\n2015). The DL-Q has been used in different therapeutic settings\nand most patients confirmed that they preferred to fill out the\nquestionnaire over a written dream report.

to discriminate successfully between dream\nrecall and content under the influence of different drugs and\nwithout medication (Lorenzo et al., 2002). The questionnaire can\neasily be integrated into a sleep diary or combined with objective\nsleep measurements such as polysomnography or ambulant\nactivity monitoring by actigraphs (Klösch et al., 2001).The DL-\nQ constitutes the basic item collection to analyze dream content,\nbut items can be added easily in order to investigate more specific\nresearch questions.\nMETHODS\nProcedure and Sample\nThe aim of this study was to compare the results of the DL-Q to\nthose obtained by the HVDC coding system.

the marked questions into a\nMS-ExcelTM – spreadsheet.\nStatistical Analyses\nTo see whether the correlation between corresponding items of\nthe DL-Q and HDVC was sufficient, point-biserial correlations\nwere calculated. All statistical analyses were carried out with\nthe Statistical Package for Social Science 26 (SPSS, IBM Corp,\n2017). On SPSS, point-biserial correlations were calculated as\nPearson correlations. For statistical analysis, the threshold for the\nrejection of the null hypothesis was set to 0.05.\nRESULTS\nThis analysis only included those items of the DL-Q with\na counterpart in the HVDC.

Body-related sensory impressions were\ncorrelated significantly with the physical and motor activity\ncaptured by the HVDC. The rating of the dream-plot\nas pleasant or unpleasant was also correlated in both\ninstruments. The remaining items did not show significant\nconcordance or could not be included in the analysis, since\nthere were no corresponding items when comparing the\nDL-Q with the HVDC.\nA post hoc power analysis showed that the sample size of 30\ndreams is sufficient (0.86) (Cohen, 1988).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study provides a first validation of the DL-Q. While\nsome of the DL-Q items were compared to the results of\nthe HVDC, others were not covered by both instruments and\na comparison was impossible.

and\na comparison was impossible. Therefore, only items of the\nsecond part of the questionnaire were included. Of those that\nwere contrasted, dominant characters, the pleasantness of a\ndream, and body-related activity correlated significantly in both\nmeasures. These aspects might be those remembered most clearly\nand least affected by memory distortions. The findings suggest\nthat the DL-Q is a promising way of analyzing dreams but\nthis investigation does not allow general conclusions. Further\nvalidity and reliability studies should be done in the future to\nsupport the findings presented in this study. Unfortunately, an\noverall comparison to other dream questionnaires is difficult,\nsince they do not include the same set of items or even the\nsame overall research question.

the DL-Q includes\ndifferent types of response categories which enables participants\nto provide more adequate answers, however, statistical analysis\nis more complicated. Also, research with a bigger sample is\nneeded in the future.\nWith the DL-Q, we hope to provide an easy-to-use tool for\nresearch and diagnostics. It facilitates the re-evaluation of the\ndream content in relation to the dreamer’s biography, goals\nand desires.

over a time period, e.g.,\nduring the course of psychological treatment. A short, and well-\nstructured instrument such as this one may enable patients with\ncognitive impairments to better remember and structure their\nthoughts on the dreaming experience.\nUnfortunately, dream questionnaires have some limitations.\nFirst, only a limited set of questions can be included, and\nimportant aspects of the dream might not be considered, or\nlead to a very vague description of the dream. Second, questions\nmight be misunderstood by the dreamer, or produce answers\nbased on one’s self-concept (Bernstein and Roberts, 1995). Third,\nthe order and types of questions may also influence the dream\ncontent retrospectively.

Bernstein and Roberts (1995)\ndeveloped a questionnaire (DCQ) based on the HCDC coding\nsystem, which asks about aspects typically experienced in dreams.\nThey differ from the DL-Q, because they only ask for general\ncharacteristics of dreams and not about one dream in particular.\nThe DL-Q might produce more accurate answers, built directly\non one specific dream.","source":"Holzinger, B., Mayer, L., Barros, I., Nierwetberg, F., & Klösch, G.

It\nmight help us understand psychological and cognitive processes\nunderlying the dream experience that are invisible and often not\naccessible for the dreamer until re-evaluating the dream content\nand its subjective meaning.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without","source":"Holzinger, B., Mayer, L., Barros, I., Nierwetberg, F., & Klösch, G.

of Psychology, Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, Neuropsychoanalysis, Universidad Intercontinental, Mexico City,\nMexico\nNeuropsychoanalysis has been established as a field based on the dialog between\npsychoanalysis and the neurosciences. Freud was a neurologist for 20 years and used\nthe neuroscientific knowledge of his time as the foundation of his metapsychology.\nPsychoanalysis has predominantly relied on its own method to develop techniques for\nthe different psychoanalytic treatments. It rarely uses contributions from fields outside\npsychoanalysis that could enrich its understanding of the mind. Neuropsychoanalysis\nhas informed and revised several topics in psychoanalysis, for example consciousness\nand the unconscious, dreams, and affect amongst many others.

The task of\nintegrating neuroscientific knowledge into psychoanalytic technique is still considered\na challenge of accentuated complexity, but it is at the same time a necessary and\npromising endeavor that aims at improving the quality of the treatments available for\nhuman suffering and psychopathology.\nKeywords: neuropsychoanalysis, clinical applications, affective neuroscience, consciousness, psychoanalytic\ntreatment\nINTRODUCTION\nNeuropsychoanalysis has been around for over 20 years.

clinical applications, affective neuroscience, consciousness, psychoanalytic\ntreatment\nINTRODUCTION\nNeuropsychoanalysis has been around for over 20 years. Clinically speaking it began its applications\nby offering psychoanalytic psychotherapy to neurological patients (Kaplan-Solms and Solms,\n2000). The benefits of this approach have filled an important gap in the therapeutic work with\nthese patients because it acknowledges that there is a subjective experience that needs to be\naddressed as part of the treatment. However, it has taken longer to use the knowledge of the\ndialog between psychoanalysis and the neurosciences in the clinical work with non-neurological\npatients.

On the other, too many schools\nmay end up splitting clinical knowledge that could be at the\ncost of the clinician’s performance in the consulting room. But\nperhaps the most important implication is that it makes it hard\nfor a person looking for help to know which approach would\nbe best for them. Furthermore, the results of psychoanalytic\ntreatments can vary widely from one clinician to the other. That is\na natural constituent of a subjective process, yet it is unclear if the\ntechnique is what works or if it depends on the person applying it.\nAn added difficulty for people in search of treatment can be to\nknow which psychotherapeutic approach is best for them, i.e., the\ndistinction between psychoanalysis and psychodynamically or\npsychoanalytically oriented psychotherapies, whose differences\ncan be hard to discriminate even for some clinicians in the field.\nFurther problems will be detailed in other sections of this p","source":"Flores Mosri, D.

of conceptualizing in psychoanalysis starts with\nFreud’s writings. His work was ongoing, and it was not infrequent\nthat he changed his views about certain topics and hence, needed\nto modify the concepts in his theoretical work. Sometimes he\nexplained the reasons for these changes and informed readers\nabout new data integrated into previous ideas. At other times he\ndid not clarify that a concept had been modified or the reasons\nto use a different perspective. The latter has given Freud as\nmany interpretations of his work as readers are which is hardly\na problem if it only relates to a theory of the mind.

papers and books.\nA new edition of Freud’s complete psychological works (Solms,\n2018a) may contribute to clarifying some of the conceptual issues\nrelated to drives and instincts just to mention one example. The\nunreliability on the various editions has led to confusion and\nmisleading interpretations of Freud’s work.\nTo summarize, Freud’s theory of the mind is the pilar of\npsychoanalytic practice and still the most comprehensive. As\nmentioned before, if it holds paradoxes and obscure concepts,\nclinical work becomes uncertain as well.

The immense advantage\nof such overlap is the possibility of confirming one hypothesis\nacross different schools and authors in psychoanalysis.

Moreover, a dialog with other fields could be\nfacilitated by clear conceptual foundations. For instance, if the\nconcept of repression has different meanings for different authors\nand clinicians, attempting to operationalize it for further research\nrenders almost impossible (e.g., see Boag, 2006; Erdelyi, 2006).\nHow clin","source":"Flores Mosri, D.

repression has different meanings for different authors\nand clinicians, attempting to operationalize it for further research\nrenders almost impossible (e.g., see Boag, 2006; Erdelyi, 2006).\nHow clinicians conceptualize repression may change the whole\nobjective of their work. And repression is only one example\namongst many. Psychoanalytic theory can benefit from detailed\nrevisions to facilitate more testing of concepts (Kandel, 1999) and\nan ongoing clarification of how the mind works that in turn may\npromote more quality in clinical approaches.

the creation\nof new grand theories of the mind that may explain empirical\nproblems that bring about hypotheses to be tested. The first step\nhence is the recognition of those problems that have a direct\nimpact on clinical work.\nThe Unconscious Mind, Repression, and\nMemory\nDespite the different schools and perspectives in psychoanalytic\nthinking the foremost topic remains the unconscious mind. The\nidea that making the unconscious conscious is the main goal of\npsychoanalytic treatment may be challenged by neuroscientific\nfindings or at least its sense may change after considering some\nimportant facts. The dynamic unconscious is based on the\nnotion that repression turns excessively painful experiences into\nunconscious split representations. Freud’s first proposal referred\nto biographical episodes that were forgotten due to the intolerable\naffect that accompanied them (Breuer and Freud, 1893-1895;\nFreud, 1894, 1895/1950).

in multiple memory systems which renders\nit hard to forget, at least in its entirety. Furthermore, memory\nresponds to Ribot’s law which claims that older memories are less\nvulnerable to forgetting which can be explained by consolidation\nprocesses (Alberini, 2005). Hence, the idea of a memory that\nis fully forgotten is unlikely. Mnemonic diversity allows for a\nmemory to be stored and to have an influence on behavior\n(Solms and Turnbull, 2002). However, there is a number of\nclinicians that seem to stick to the idea of forgotten repressed\nautobiographical memories. Boag (2006) considered this fact\nas a pathology of science with enormous implications on how\nclinical work is conducted. Neuropsychoanalytic contributions\nalso explain how forgetting a traumatic episode may not relate\nwith the notion of repression.\nThe diverse memory systems recruit different anatomical\nregions and circuits.

If one memory system is impaired, the\nother systems may remain functional (Milner et al., 1998) as\nextensive studies with patient HM demonstrated2 (Squire, 2009).\nPsychoanalytic technique relies predominantly on declarative\nmemory, namely, episodes that can be described in words. If an\nexperience cannot be expressed verbally, it is generally thought\nthat it is repressed. The latter can be challenged when the\ndifferent memory systems and the way in which they work are\nconsidered. Memories can fail to be declared if the episodic\nmemory system that relies on the hippocampus is not involved\nin memory formation. One known cause relates to stressful\nexperiences that activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\n(HPA axis). If a person goes through a traumatic event, it may\nbe the case that the release of cortisol blocks the function of\nthe hippocampus (LeDoux, 1996; Yovell et al., 2015) w","source":"Flores Mosri, D.

axis\n(HPA axis). If a person goes through a traumatic event, it may\nbe the case that the release of cortisol blocks the function of\nthe hippocampus (LeDoux, 1996; Yovell et al., 2015) which in\nturn impedes the formation of an episodic memory of the event.\nThus, the episode is not forgotten or repressed; it was simply\nnot coded in an episodic format in which it could be retrieved\nverbally.

As a classical imaginary example, if Pavlov’s dog visited\na psychoanalyst’s office to try to stop salivating when it hears\nbells, the dog would not be able to tell the psychoanalyst\nabout the conditions in which the association was established.\nFurthermore, even if the dog could put the whole episode\ninto words, that would still not modify the association (see\nAlberini’s opinion in Flores Mosri, 2020). People are constantly\nexposed to spontaneous associative learning that is not coded\nepisodically. This type of unconscious memory does not relate\nto repression and the dynamic unconscious in its traditional\nconceptualization. Notwithstanding it plays a crucial role on\nmental life. A neuropsychoanalytic approach to this type of\nformulation can clarify that some unconscious contents are\nnot susceptible of becoming cognitively conscious. Given this\ncondition, it seems relevant to question how useful it would be\nto put them into words and how else they can be","source":"Flores Mosri, D. (2021).

unconscious contents are\nnot susceptible of becoming cognitively conscious. Given this\ncondition, it seems relevant to question how useful it would be\nto put them into words and how else they can be tackled during\npsychoanalytic treatments.\nHence, clinical work needs access to those procedural\nand emotional memories through different methods. Freud\n(1938) suggested that transference was an essential part of\npsychoanalytic treatment. Therefore, understanding the different\ntypes of memories is relevant for clinical work, e.g., short-\nterm working memory and long-term explicit and implicit\nmemory systems. It has been hypothesized that transference\nrelates to procedural and emotional memory (Turnbull et al.,\n2006; Moore et al., 2017). Knowing how these systems work\ncan help to conduct more precise technical interventions during\nthe treatment. More about the implications of this type of\nunconscious memories will be addressed in terms of affect in\nother sections of this paper.\nThe question","source":"Flores Mosri, D. (2021).

The discharge could happen\neither through movement or through association. Speaking\nabout traumatic events led to movement and thus discharge.\nAbreaction or catharsis would then represent the beginning of\nthe talking cure. Freud elaborated on Breuer’s initial model when\nhe realized that verbalizing experiences that were characterized\nby negative affect was not sufficient to solve symptoms.

2011; Panksepp and Biven, 2012) explained\nthat there are three types of primary affects, namely sensory,\nhomeostatic, and emotional. They are shared by all mammalian\nbrains and aim at survival. Solms (2021) considers that the\nthree types of affects are homeostatic as they seek to satisfy the\nneeds that come from the body. Negative affects indicate that\nthere is a lack of homeostasis, i.e., that a need must be met.\nUnpleasurable feelings drive the mind to perform work and\nsolve problems. In contrast, positive affects signal the return to\na homeostatic state that is subjectively felt as pleasure.

unsatisfied\nneeds that drive the mind to perform work to meet them. In\nhis opinion, there is a predominant need at a time that will\ngain conscious attention. This need should be identified in the\npsychotherapeutic process to particularly work on it. Solms (in\npress b) has also asserted that the basic emotions conflict with one\nanother and that it is the task of the mind to solve these conflicts.\nSolms’ proposal to include the knowledge of Panksepp’s\naffective neuroscience into psychoanalytic technique expands\nthe meaning of affects and adds complexity to the topic.\nMany clinicians think that expressing affects in words solves\nsymptomatic formulations. They may refer to an unconscious\nquality of affects, i.e., repressed affects, that become conscious\nwhen they are put into words and next understood and associated\nto representations.

understood and associated\nto representations. Just like Freud, Panksepp and Biven (2012)\nstated that affects are always conscious and Solms (2021) has\nrecently highlighted this conscious quality of affect. According\nto his proposal, affect is felt, namely, it is experienced and\nconstitutes the fundamental quality of consciousness. Panksepp\n(2011) underscored the difficulties that we may encounter to\nrecognize raw affects due to our predominant cognitive thinking.\nHowever, he emphasized that affects are experienced whether\nwe pay cognitive attention to our feelings or not; he declared\nthat feeling is compulsive, i.e., we cannot stop feeling which\nmay be due to the fact that subjective experience favors survival.\nThis acknowledgment led to further revisions of the Freudian\nconcept of the id.

Tertiary process emotions are more available to be\nexpressed verbally as opposed to primary and secondary-process\nemotions. Psychoanalytic technique has kept its foundations\non a cortico-centric view of affect and consciousness, possibly\nfollowing Freud (1920) or perhaps not even questioning whether\nneuroscientific data could inform the subject of consciousness\nand the unconscious, and lead to relevant revisions to both theory\nand technique. If emotions are conceptualized as cognitive, then\nit makes sense to emphasize the relevance of verbalizing them.\nWhen it is acknowledged that affects are felt, whether cognitive\nattention is given to them or not, then a substantial revision\nseems essential.\nCommunicating","source":"Flores Mosri, D.

the relevance of verbalizing them.\nWhen it is acknowledged that affects are felt, whether cognitive\nattention is given to them or not, then a substantial revision\nseems essential.\nCommunicating feelings in verbal language may entail various\nrestrictions. Words express as accurately as possible what is\nbeing felt, yet subjective experience cannot be translated into a\nprecise cognitive report as its nature is to be felt. Thinking of\naffects can be a useful instrument for psychoanalytic treatments\nas it will provide some information about what a person\nthinks that they feel or felt. However, the most reliable method\nso far to infer what someone else feels is the transference-\ncountertransference quality of the therapeutic relationship. This\nmethod, however, involves other restrictions. The reliability\non one’s opinion about what someone else feels is always\nlimited, as one can only feel one’s own subjectivity.

Thus,\nthe decision about what emotion is predominant in a person’s\nlife to design a psychoanalytic treatment may be biased and\nmay differ from one clinician to another. Hence, a method that\nanalyzes affects considering different dimensions may constitute\nan effective way to comprehend what affects are signaling during\npsychoanalytic treatments.\nTo assess how affects work, two aspects are generally\nconsidered. First, the spontaneous reactions to the current\ncontext, namely, the present affective feeling. Second, a more\ngeneral appraisal of the overall affective responses that the person\npredominantly experiences in a sustained way (i.e., mood). The\nanalysis here proposed discusses a method to help clinicians\nunderstand their impressions","source":"Flores Mosri, D. (2021).

when a person speaks without\ndirect eye contact with another person, body language is rarely\nused. The face-to-face format mainly used in psychodynamic\npsychotherapies evokes nonverbal expressions of affect which are\na valuable source of information to complement other subjective\nimpressions of the clinician.\nOther behavioral sources can be relevant to add information\nto the analysis of affect. Classically clinicians in psychoanalysis\nare trained to pay little attention to the patient’s behavior and\nconditionings. Yet, the free associations of patients tend to\ndescribe behaviors which following Panksepp (2011) can take\nmainly two forms. The first one refers to the primary instinctual\nbehavioral patterns triggered by unconditioned stimuli, that\nis, unconditioned responses.

These learned patterns recruit long-term\nimplicit memory systems such as the procedural and emotional\nsubsystems. Procedural patterns automatize behavioral skills and\nhabits and keep mainly an unconscious nature (Kandel, 1999;\nSolms, 2017). Associations are established by recruiting affective\ncircuits such as in fear conditioning in which an emotional\nreaction can be triggered by a specific stimulus whose associative\ncontext can remain unknown to the person experiencing it.

impressions of what the\npatient is feeling.\n(3) With regard to the cognitive ideas about feelings,\nas mentioned before, psychoanalytic practice has relied on\nthe verbal expression of affects as an essential part of\nthe treatment. The concept of alexithymia (Sifneos, 1973)\nstressed the importance of identifying and describing feelings\nin words as this function is not available to people who\nkeep an operational life (Marty, 1990) that makes them\nemphatically vulnerable to psychosomatic symptoms. Hence, the\nverbalization of feelings became one of the clearest objectives\nof psychoanalytic treatments, particularly for narcissistic and\nborderline personalities that do not seem to align with Freud’s\nideas of intrapsychic conflict. Two main premises seem to\nbe used to understand this therapeutic goal. First, that affect\ncan be unconscious and second, that affect needs to be\nassociated to representations.

which they operate. Affect necessarily involves a complex\nneurochemistry that relies on neuroanatomical circuits, seven,\naccording to Panksepp (1998). Affect as the indicator of somatic\nand other needs has at least three levels of problem-solving\ndescribed in Figure 1. The level that the cognitive dimension aims\nat describing is that of tertiary-process cognitions. Knowing the\ncognitive contents of the mind entails to consider that affect is\nalways first, i.e., every thought comes from a feeling as affect is the\nfoundation of psychic life. Thus, when a patient describes their\nideas, they are already speaking about affect and it would be the\nclinician’s job to infer the emotional contents from the discourse\nby relying on the support from the rest of the dimensions of affect\nanalysis.

11 --\n\nFlores Mosri Clinical Applications of Neuropsychoanalysis\nFIGURE 1 | The three levels of problem solving. Figure illustrates how negative affect triggers different levels of behavior as an attempt to solve needs and problems\nto diminish or eliminate the subjective feeling of negative affects. When the primary-process instinctual programs fail at problem solution, the secondary-process\nlearnings are needed. If in turn the second level is unsuccessful then the tertiary-process cognitions are required. The return to homeostasis is signaled by a positive\naffect.\nor not without the appropriate testing. Again, this elaborates on\nthe importance of relying on different dimensions of analysis to\nfurther underpin clinical hypotheses.\nPsychopathology Based on the Analysis\nof Affect\nA topic that requires much work is that of symptoms and\npsychoanalytic diagnosis.

symptom (Freud, 1894). This description\ndelineates the formation of a neurotic symptom that can\nbe interpreted. Freud proposed the existence of unconscious\nfantasies that led to intrapsychic conflict and scarcely worked\non the topic of trauma after 1897, more common in narcissistic\nand borderline organizations. In these cases, patients suffer from\nintense separation distress due to narcissistic injuries related to\nabandonment, rejection, abuse, and/or ambivalent feelings from\nthe primary objects (Flores Mosri, 2017, 2019a). This type of\nformulation excludes the intrapsychic conflict and instead is\ncharacterized by pervasive and persistent negative affects derived\nfrom the traumatic experience that recruits several structures,\namongst others, the amygdala, a limbic structure that associates\nfeelings of fear and/or anger with determined stimuli. What\nthe amygdala learns is hardly forgotten, which can be explained\nevolutionarily as a means to predict future threatening situations.\nI","source":"Flores Mosri, D. (2021).

usually providing an\nenvironment of certainty that results in basic trust (Erikson,\n1950). The infant then learns how to avoid prediction errors and\nminimize free energy, which in turn means positive affective\nfeelings.

such as the amygdala and the nucleus\naccumbens, generally related to reward (Berridge et al., 2009). As\nexplained before, learned associations are not forgotten in order\nto predict threatening situations. If enhanced remembering\nof these contexts improves the possibility of surviving, then\nthe negative affect must remain active. Overcoming trauma\nthen entails accepting the defensive and adaptive objective of\nemotional memory.\nIn cases such as protracted separation distress, when the\nprimary caregivers were not able to be predictable or when they\nwere not able to provide the infant with a safe environment,\nchronic depressive feelings may arise (Marty, 1966; Bergeret,\n1975b; Watt and Panksepp, 2009; Flores Mosri, 2019a).

first is that some\nneeds and problems cannot be solved. If parents are unable to be\nreliable, there is not much that the infant can do to modify this\nsituation. The unsatisfied need will persistently cause negative\naffect indications that promote various symptom formations.\nHence, the second instance is that the psychotherapeutic process\nshould include mourning for what cannot be solved. It implies\nthe challenging task of accepting the frustration that derives\nfrom unsolved problems and generating alternative legitimate\nstrategies to handle the existence of chronic negative feelings.\nThus, the idea that repetition compulsion is an expression of\na death drive is challenged by neuropsychoanalytic knowledge.\nThe reason why unsuccessful behavioral patterns are repeated\nrelates to the involvement of procedural and emotional memory\nsystems that recruit neuroanatomical structures that automatize\nthe associations that they learn, for example the basal ganglia and\nthe amygdala.

Cognitive understanding of why one smokes does\nnot stop the addictive behavior. This example calls for a top-down\nregulation of affective associations based on voluntarily inhibiting\nthe repetition of inefficacious behavior patterns creating a conflict\nbetween spontaneous responses and the planned decision to try\nalternative solutions facilitated by working memory thinking.\nHowever, it should be mentioned that this type of top-down\nregulation means such a significant effort that many people fail\non repeated attempts. Clinicians can easily interpret a death drive\nunder these circumstances. No neurobiological evidence has been\nfound to support Freud’s hypothesis of a death drive or instinct.\nAll types of negative affects aim at driving the person toward a\nspecific action that will solve problems.
